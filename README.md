# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project 
Refactoring VBA code and measuring performance speed for stock analysis.

## Results
The results show a significant decrease in return between 2017 and 2018. The is no direct correlation with volume and returns exhibited in the data however, the outlier of the dataset is the "RUN" ticker. The stock for "RUN" saw an increase of 300 million in volume and a 78.5% increase in return. 

## Summary 
The advantages to refactoring code is to improve efficiency. Ensuring the code being used is the most direct way to access the dataset with the least amount of steps cna reduce runtime and in turn improve the efficiency of the analysis. A disadvantage to refactoring code is the time it can take away from the actual analysis. Refactoring code comes with a sacrafice in time and defining all needs to improve the efficiency of your code. 

This applies to the the VBA Challenge code in part that it took time to refactor a code that already produce the necessary data to evaluate and formulate an analysis. Formatting the code to be more presentable added improvements to key factors in the dataset however, if time is a priority in the assessment of the dataset then refactoring the code may not be as beneficial.
